# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

###  `Architecture` to the code compile solution
To compile code and display the output in your web-based code editor using **CodeMirror 6**, you'll need a combination of front-end and back-end tools. Here's how you can approach it:

---

### **1. Front-End Setup**
- Use CodeMirror 6 for syntax highlighting and code editing.
- Add a dedicated area or modal to display output.

#### **Basic CodeMirror Integration Example**:
```javascript
import { EditorView, basicSetup } from "codemirror";
import { javascript } from "@codemirror/lang-javascript";

const editor = new EditorView({
  doc: "// Write your code here...",
  extensions: [basicSetup, javascript()],
  parent: document.getElementById("editor"),
});
```

#### **Add an Output Section**:
```html
<div id="output"></div>
```

---

### **2. Language Support for Compilation**
The way you compile code depends on the language:

#### **a. Client-Side Execution**
- For languages like **JavaScript**, you can use the browser's built-in interpreter.
- Example:
  ```javascript
  function executeCode() {
    const code = editor.state.doc.toString();
    try {
      const result = eval(code); // Caution: Avoid eval in production.
      document.getElementById("output").textContent = result;
    } catch (err) {
      document.getElementById("output").textContent = `Error: ${err.message}`;
    }
  }
  ```

#### **b. Server-Side Compilation**
- For languages like Python, C++, or Java, you'll need a server to compile and execute the code.
- Steps:
  1. Send the code from the editor to the server using an API.
  2. Compile and execute the code on the server.
  3. Return the output to the front end.

---

### **3. Back-End Setup**
Choose a language-execution environment like Docker-based sandboxes for isolation.

#### **a. Node.js Example (for JavaScript Execution)**:
```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

app.post("/execute", (req, res) => {
  const { code } = req.body;
  try {
    const result = eval(code); // Use a secure sandbox in production.
    res.send({ output: result });
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(400).send({ error: err.message });
  }
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log("Server running on port 3000"));
```

#### **b. Python Example**:
Use tools like `subprocess` to execute the code:
```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import subprocess

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/execute", methods=["POST"])
def execute():
    code = request.json.get("code")
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(["python3", "-c", code], text=True, capture_output=True, check=True)
        return jsonify({"output": result.stdout})
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        return jsonify({"error": e.stderr}), 400

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(port=3000)
```

---

### **4. Connecting Front-End and Back-End**
Send code to the server and retrieve output:

#### **JavaScript Fetch Example**:
```javascript
async function compileAndRun() {
  const code = editor.state.doc.toString();
  try {
    const response = await fetch("http://localhost:3000/execute", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ code }),
    });
    const data = await response.json();
    document.getElementById("output").textContent = data.output || data.error;
  } catch (error) {
    document.getElementById("output").textContent = "Error connecting to server.";
  }
}
```

---

### **5. Security Considerations**
- **Client-Side Execution**:
  - Avoid using `eval` in production. Use a secure sandbox like `vm2` in Node.js.
- **Server-Side Execution**:
  - Use containers (e.g., Docker) to isolate code execution.
  - Limit execution time and memory to prevent abuse.
  - Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks.

---

### **6. Enhancements**
- Add support for multiple languages (e.g., by using tools like **Judge0** or custom Docker containers).
- Show real-time logs in the output section.
- Implement error handling for compilation failures.

Let me know which language(s) you plan to support, and I can tailor the implementation further!
